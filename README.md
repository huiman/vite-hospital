## Description
- [vite+swc](https://vitejs.dev/) framework vite TypeScript swc starter repository.
- In this project, I experiment by attempting to implement a coding structure of React Router 6 or Remix style. 


## Installation

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Running the app

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

## additionsal library usage
- axios
- dayjs
- react router
- semantic react ui

## note
- the full remix style of code may not that effecient. alternate using the react-query would be.

## still not implement
- login page
- websock
